# Share-your-Dog / "Bark BnB"
An AirBnB-styled web application, created as part as a group during the intensive 9-week web development bootcamp at Le Wagon, Tokyo. This application intends to match users that seek a dog for a short-term basis with owners that seek to give their pet more enrichment, so that both parties can benefit.
